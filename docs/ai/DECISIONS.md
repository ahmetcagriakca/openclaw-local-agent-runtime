# Architectural Decisions

**Last updated:** 2026-03-23

All decisions below are frozen. Reopening requires explicit phase gate approval.

---

## D-001: Single Execution Owner = oc runtime

**Phase:** 1.5-A | **Status:** Frozen

oc runtime is the only component that may queue, execute, retry, cancel, or report health on tasks.

---

## D-002: Terminology — orchestration vs conversation flow

**Phase:** 1.5-A | **Status:** Frozen

"Orchestration" = task execution orchestration, sole owner: oc runtime. OpenClaw = conversation flow, intent extraction, approval UX, result narration. Bridge = adapter / trust boundary, never an orchestrator.

---

## D-003: Worker model — ephemeral -RunOnce

**Phase:** 1.5-A | **Status:** Frozen

Each invocation claims pending tickets, processes them, exits. Persistent poll loop superseded.

---

## D-004: Bridge = stateless translation + auth gate

**Phase:** 1.5-A | **Status:** Frozen

No persistent state. One request = one API call = one response. Exception: terminal polling may use two sequential calls (get + output).

---

## D-005: External surface is task-centric

**Phase:** 1.5-A | **Status:** Frozen

Bridge contract uses task names and task IDs. No intent vocabulary at Bridge boundary.

---

## D-006: Raw action invocation forbidden externally

**Phase:** 1.5-A | **Status:** Frozen

oc-run-action.ps1 forbidden as external integration path. Runner is the only legitimate caller.

---

## D-007: Polling-only for Phase 1.5

**Phase:** 1.5-A | **Status:** Frozen

No callbacks, notifications, or webhooks. OpenClaw owns poll timing.

---

## D-008: Stuck task policy — fail-closed + dead-letter + no auto-retry

**Phase:** 1.5-A | **Status:** Frozen

Stuck tasks fail, write lastError, move to dead-letter. No auto-retry anywhere.

---

## D-009: Duplicate task creation accepted in Phase 1.5

**Phase:** 1.5-A | **Status:** Frozen

requestId is audit/correlation only, not dedupe.

---

## D-010: Retry not exposed externally in Phase 1.5

**Phase:** 1.5-C | **Status:** Frozen

retry_task is operator-only. User retry = new submit_task.

---

## D-011: External Bridge operations (Phase 1.5)

**Phase:** 1.5-C | **Status:** Frozen

Four operations: submit_task, get_task_status, cancel_task, get_health.

---

## D-012: Approval model — definition-level preapproval

**Phase:** 1.5-C | **Status:** Frozen

Runtime enforces approvalPolicy at task definition level. No policyContext. Bridge transports approvalStatus for audit only. Pending = rejected by Bridge.

---

## D-013: Allowlist fail-closed startup

**Phase:** 1.5-D | **Status:** Frozen

Missing/empty/unparseable allowlist = Bridge refuses to start (exit 2).

---

## D-014: Five-step validation order

**Phase:** 1.5-D | **Status:** Frozen

Structural → Operation → Allowlist → Field-level → Approval pre-validation. First failure stops.

---

## D-015: Operator exception — local/manual/admin-only

**Phase:** 1.5-A | **Status:** Frozen

Not part of Bridge external contract. Must not become shadow integration path.

---

## D-016: Health response sanitized

**Phase:** 1.5-D | **Status:** Frozen

Only health field (ok/degraded/error) plus wrapper fields. All runtime internals stripped.

---

## D-017: Minimum audit — 10 fields per request

**Phase:** 1.5-D | **Status:** Frozen

timestamp, requestId, source, sourceUserId, operation, taskName, approvalStatus, outcome, errorCode, runtimeTaskId.

---

## D-018: Bridge physical form — stateless single-invocation script

**Phase:** 1.5-E | **Status:** Frozen

bridge/oc-bridge.ps1, invoked once per request, produces response, exits.

---

## D-019: Canonical caller path — OpenClaw via WSL wrappers

**Phase:** TG-1R | **Status:** Frozen

OpenClaw Telegram → WSL wrappers → oc-bridge-call → pwsh.exe bridge/oc-bridge.ps1 → runtime.

---

## D-020: Project identity

**Phase:** Post-1.5 | **Status:** Active

Project: OpenClaw Local Agent Runtime. Repo: openclaw-local-agent-runtime.
